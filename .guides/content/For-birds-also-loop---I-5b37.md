We'll now introduce another kind of loop - the *for* loop. The for loop does exactly the same thing as the *while* loop, but it does it in a slightly different way. The for loop is generally preferred to *while* loops in Javascript.

The *while* loop statement just deals with the condition (`while(counter<7)` in our previous example).

||| definition
The *for* loop statement allows you to handle the following things

1. The initialization of your variables.
1. The condition.
1. What happens at the very end of the loop.
