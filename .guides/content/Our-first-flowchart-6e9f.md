A *flowchart* or *flow diagram* is an extremely useful way of visualizing an algorithm or process. Rather than seeing the process as list of steps, it breaks the steps into graphical blocks. 

When things get a bit more complex, this visualisation becomes even more helpful as we'll see in a later section.
