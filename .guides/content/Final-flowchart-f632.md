Take a look at the `main.js` code on the left. Let's flowchart the `checkBird()` function.

Note how we have used a special shape for the `createBird()` function call. This shape denotes something that happens on screen. You could just have well used as regular rectangular box but there are special shapes for different purposes, which you can use if you want.

In a later module, we'll look at flowcharting in more detail. There's really not much to it.
